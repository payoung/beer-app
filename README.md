========

This project displays temperature sesnsor data using the Python Flask framework and the Javascript Flot librrary.  I created this poroject so that I could keep track of my hombrew fermentation temperatures.  This repo contains the server side of the code, the sensor code is here: https://github.com/payoung/ferm-monitor

This project is still in development, so some of the code is going to be a bit rough, and I am still working on adding some much needed features like tempaerature profile control.  I have a live instance of the project running here: http://beer.pyoung.net/
